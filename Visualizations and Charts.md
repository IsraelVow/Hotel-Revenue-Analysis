The sparkline line chart is a customized line chart designed as sparklines, placed below each card. It utilizes the same measures used in the cards as fields and values. This visualization provides a quick visual trend of revenue, ADR, nights, discounts, and car spaces over time.

3. **Slicers for Filtering:**
